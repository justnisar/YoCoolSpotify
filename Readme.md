# YoCoolSpotify
A lightweight REST API to manage Spotify/Youtube playlists with your friends over a local network.
This repository acts as a central hub or a server in your home. You and your friends can add songs to it on the fly and use it like a collective playlist. The project is currently in development and the functionality is limited at this time but there are plans to make this a general purpose API in the future.
